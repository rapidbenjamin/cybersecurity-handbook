# Attacks explained

The idea of this section is to explain in detail several attacks that we can face in our day to day activities.

## Common attacks

There is a section of the book dedicated to the [most Common Types of Cyber Attacks](/about_cybersecurity/common_attacks). Before you start to review specific attacks it's good to have a great understanding of the most general techniques, so you will be much better prepared for the attack, the context and the possible solutions or mitigations.

## Specific attacks to our environment

Below contains a list of detailed attacks and mitigations/solutions.

Most of these attacks have been used in the most [Notable Security Incidents](/notable_security_incidents) in our ecosystem.
