## üéØ Scope

This digital handbook was crafted by the One Beyond team in order to provide a simple and easy guide for newcomers. 

This handbook was made based in our current stack (JS/Node.js/Docker..) and needs in our day to day activities...

This section customized for [our stack](#stack-in-scope) using/mixing/re-writing the following guides:
