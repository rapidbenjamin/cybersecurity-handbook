# HTTP Header: Hide Powered-By

## The attack

By default [Express will add an `X-Powered-by: Express` header](https://github.com/expressjs/express/blob/master/lib/middleware/init.js#L30) in to your application and there are [no plans to remove it](https://github.com/expressjs/express/pull/2813#issuecomment-159270428)

As an example you can see almost 1 million servers with the `X-Powered-By: Express` active in [Shodan queries](https://www.shodan.io/search?query=X-Powered-By%3A+Express)

## The header

Even if this header does not represent a vulnerability still being very relevant to hardening our server

## The code

Helmet will hide by default the `x-powered-by`.

```js
const helmet = require('helmet')

app.use(helmet())
```

You can disable it using express without helmet

```js
app.disable('x-powered-by')
```

### Extra mile: throw an attacker off the scent

Why not using a different `x-powered-by` value:

```js
const helmet = require('helmet')

app.use(helmet())
app.use(helmet.hidePoweredBy({ setTo: 'PHP 4.2.0' }))
```
