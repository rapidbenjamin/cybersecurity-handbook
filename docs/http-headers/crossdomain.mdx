# HTTP Header: X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies

## The attack

Adobe Flash and Adobe Acrobat can load content from your domain even from other sites (in other words, cross-domain). This could cause unexpected data disclosure in rare cases or extra bandwidth usage.

## The header

The `X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies` header tells clients like Flash and Acrobat what cross-domain policies they can use. If you don’t want them to load data from your domain, set the header’s value to none. For example:

```
X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies: none
```

If Flash loads something from your site and sees that, it’ll know that it shouldn’t load data from your domain.

## The code

Helmet’s `crossdomain` middleware prevents Adobe Flash and Adobe Acrobat from loading content on your site.

```js
const helmet = require('helmet')

// Sets "X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies: none"
app.use(helmet.permittedCrossDomainPolicies())
```
