# C4: Encode and Escape Data


## Description

Encoding and escaping are defensive techniques meant to stop injection attacks. **Encoding**
(commonly called "Output Encoding") involves translating special characters into some
different but equivalent form that is no longer dangerous in the target interpreter, for
example translating the `<` character into the `&lt;` string when writing to an **HTML page**.
Escaping involves adding a special character before the character/string to avoid it being
misinterpreted, for example, adding a `\` character before a `"` (double quote) character so
that it is interpreted as text and not as closing a string.

Output encoding is best applied **just before** the content is passed to the target interpreter. If
this defense is performed too early in the processing of a request then the encoding or
escaping may interfere with the use of the content in other parts of the program. For
example if you HTML escape content before storing that data in the database and the UI
automatically escapes that data a second time then the content will not display properly due
to being double escaped. 

## Implementation

### Contextual Output Encoding

Contextual output encoding is a crucial security programming technique needed to stop XSS.
This defense is performed on output, when youâ€™re building a user interface, at the last
moment before untrusted data is dynamically added to HTML. The type of encoding will
depend on the location (or context) in the document where data is being displayed or stored.
The different types of encoding that would be used for building secure user interfaces
includes HTML Entity Encoding, HTML Attribute Encoding, JavaScript Encoding, and URL
Encoding.


### Other Types of Encoding and Injection Defense

Encoding/Escaping can be used to neutralize content against other forms of injection. For
example, it's possible to neutralize certain special meta-characters when adding input to an
operating system command. This is called "OS command escaping", "shell escaping", or
similar. This defense can be used to stop "Command Injection" vulnerabilities.
There are other forms of escaping that can be used to stop injection such as XML attribute
escaping stopping various forms of XML and XML path injection, as well as LDAP distinguished
name escaping that can be used to stop various forms of LDAP injection.


#### Character Encoding and Canonicalization

Unicode Encoding is a method for storing characters with multiple bytes. Wherever input
data is allowed, data can be entered using [Unicode](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Unicode_Encoding) to disguise malicious code and permit a
variety of attacks. [RFC 2279](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2279) references many ways that text can be encoded.
Canonicalization is a method in which systems convert data into a simple or standard form.
Web applications commonly use character canonicalization to ensure all content is of the
same character type when stored or displayed.
To be secure against canonicalization related attacks means an application should be safe
when malformed Unicode and other malformed character representations are entered.
