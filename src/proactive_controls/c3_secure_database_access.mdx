# C3: Secure Database Access


## Description

This section describes secure access to all data stores, including both relational databases and
NoSQL databases. Some areas to consider:

### Secure Queries

SQL Injection occurs when untrusted user input is dynamically added to a SQL query in an
insecure manner, often via basic string concatenation. SQL Injection is one of the most
dangerous application security risks. SQL Injection is easy to exploit and could lead to the
entire database being stolen, wiped, or modified. The application can even be used to run
dangerous commands against the operating system hosting your database, thereby giving an
attacker a foothold on your network.

In order to mitigate SQL injection, untrusted input should be prevented from being
interpreted as part of a SQL command. The best way to do this is with the programming
technique known as ‘Query Parameterization’. This defense should be applied to SQL, OQL, as
well as stored procedure construction.

### Caution on Query Parameterization

Certain locations in a database query are not parameterizable. These locations are different
for each database vendor. Be certain to do very careful exact-match validation or manual
escaping when confronting database query parameters that cannot be bound to a
parameterized query. Also, while the use of parameterized queries largely has a positive
impact on performance, certain parameterized queries in specific database implementations
will affect performance negatively. Be sure to test queries for performance; especially
complex queries with extensive like clause or text searching capabilities. 

## Implementation

### Secure Configuration

Unfortunately, database management systems do not always ship in a “secure by default”
configuration. Care must be taken to ensure that the security controls available from the
Database Management System (DBMS) and hosting platform are enabled and properly
configured. There are standards, guides, and benchmarks available for most common DBMS.


### Secure Authentication

All access to the database should be properly authenticated. Authentication to the DBMS
should be accomplished in a secure manner. Authentication should take place only over a
secure channel. Credentials must be properly secured and available for use. 


### Secure Communication

Most DBMS support a variety of communications methods (services, APIs, etc) - secure
(authenticated, encrypted) and insecure (unauthenticated or unencrypted). It is a good
practice to only use the secure communications options per the Protect Data Everywhere
control.
