# C2: Leverage Security Frameworks and Libraries

## Description

Secure coding libraries and software frameworks with embedded security help software
developers guard against security-related design and implementation flaws. A developer
writing an application from scratch might not have sufficient knowledge, time, or budget to
properly implement or maintain security features. Leveraging security frameworks helps
accomplish security goals more efficiently and accurately.

## Implementation
When incorporating third party libraries or frameworks into your software, it is important to
consider the following best practices:
1. Use libraries and frameworks from trusted sources that are actively maintained and
widely used by many applications.
2. Create and maintain an inventory catalog of all the third party libraries.
3. Proactively keep libraries and components up to date. Use a tool like OWASP
Dependency Check and Retire.JS to identify project dependencies and check if there
are any known, publicly disclosed vulnerabilities for all third party code.
4. Reduce the attack surface by encapsulating the library and expose only the required
behaviour into your software.

## Vulnerabilities Prevented

Secure frameworks and libraries can help to prevent a wide range of web application
vulnerabilities. It is critical to keep these frameworks and libraries up to date
