# Buffer Overflow Attack

## The Attack

This attack is very common in a lot of frameworks and coding languages and require a great low-level understanding.

In Nodejs there was a bug in the `Buffer` core library that was [reported in 2016](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/4660#issue-126343377) by [Feross Aboukhadijeh (feross)](https://twitter.com/feross) that was fixed in Nodejs already.

> If an attacker can make your program call the Buffer constructor with a Number argument, then they can make it allocate uninitialized memory from the node.js process. **This could potentially disclose TLS private keys, user data, or database passwords.**
> by [Feross Aboukhadijeh](https://github.com/feross) in [Nodejs Github](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/4660#issue-126343377)

Due compatibility reasons the old API still available. The Nodejs team added a warning message if you use it or if it was introduced by any of your dependencies.

```
(node:7147) [DEP0005] DeprecationWarning: 
	The Buffer() and new Buffer() constructors are not recommended 
    for use due to security and usability concerns. Please use 
    the new Buffer.alloc(), Buffer.allocUnsafe(), or Buffer.from() 
	construction methods instead.

    [... more stack trace lines ...]
```


## The solution

Avoid the old Buffer API:

```js
// [DEPRECATED] new Buffer(number) 
Buffer.alloc(number).
 
// [DEPRECATED]  new Buffer(string) 
Buffer.from(string) 
 
// [DEPRECATED]  new Buffer(string, encoding))
Buffer.from(string, encoding)
 
// [DEPRECATED] new Buffer(...arguments) 
Buffer.from(...arguments)
```

In case that you need to keep the legacy Buffer code running, please use [safe-buffer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/safe-buffer) as a fast mitigation option.
