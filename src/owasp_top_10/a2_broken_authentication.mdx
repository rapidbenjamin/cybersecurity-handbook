# A2 Broken Authentication


## Definition

Application functions related to authentication and session management are often implemented
incorrectly, allowing attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens, or to exploit
other implementation flaws to assume other users‚Äô identities temporarily or permanently.

## Risk Factor Summary

- Score: 7.0
- Attack Vectors Exploitability: 3
- Security Weakness Prevalence: 2
- Security Weakness Detectability: 2
- Impact Technical: 3

## Context

Attackers have access to hundreds of
millions of valid username and
password combinations for credential
stuffing, default administrative
account lists, automated brute force,
and dictionary attack tools. Session
management attacks are well
understood, particularly in relation to
unexpired session tokens. 


The prevalence of broken authentication is
widespread due to the design and implementation of
most identity and access controls. Session management is the bedrock of authentication and access
controls, and is present in all stateful applications.


Attackers can detect broken authentication using
manual means and exploit them using automated
tools with password lists and dictionary attacks.


Attackers have to gain access to only
a few accounts, or just one admin
account to compromise the system.
Depending on the domain of the
application, this may allow money
laundering, social security fraud, and
identity theft, or disclose legally
protected highly sensitive information.

## Is the Application Vulnerable?

Confirmation of the user's identity, authentication, and session
management are critical to protect against authentication-related
attacks.
There may be authentication weaknesses if the application:
- Permits automated attacks such as [credential stuffing](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Credential_stuffing), where
the attacker has a list of valid usernames and passwords.
- Permits brute force or other automated attacks.
- Permits default, weak, or well-known passwords, such as
"Password1" or "admin/admin‚Äú.
- Uses weak or ineffective credential recovery and forgotpassword processes, such as "knowledge-based answers",
which cannot be made safe.
- Uses plain text, encrypted, or weakly hashed passwords (see
[A3:2017-Sensitive Data Exposure](/owasp/a3_sensitived_data_exposure)).
- Has missing or ineffective multi-factor authentication.
- Exposes Session IDs in the URL (e.g., URL rewriting).
- Does not rotate Session IDs after successful login.
- Does not properly invalidate Session IDs. User sessions or
authentication tokens (particularly single sign-on (SSO) tokens)
aren‚Äôt properly invalidated during logout or a period of inactivity. 

## How to Prevent

- Where possible, implement multi-factor authentication to
prevent automated, credential stuffing, brute force, and stolen
credential re-use attacks.
- Do not ship or deploy with any default credentials, particularly
for admin users.
- Implement weak-password checks, such as testing new or
changed passwords against a list of [the top 10000 worst
passwords](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Passwords).
- Align password length, complexity and rotation policies with
[NIST 800-63 B's guidelines in section 5.1.1 for Memorized
Secrets](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html#memsecret) or other modern, evidence based password policies.
- Ensure registration, credential recovery, and API pathways are
hardened against account enumeration attacks by using the
same messages for all outcomes.
- Limit or increasingly delay failed login attempts. Log all failures
and alert administrators when credential stuffing, brute force, or
other attacks are detected.
- Use a server-side, secure, built-in session manager that
generates a new random session ID with high entropy after
login. Session IDs should not be in the URL, be securely stored
and invalidated after logout, idle, and absolute timeouts.


## Example Attack Scenarios

### Scenario #1: 
[Credential stuffing](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists), the use of [lists of known passwords](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists), is a common attack. If an application does not
implement automated threat or credential stuffing protections, the
application can be used as a password oracle to determine if the
credentials are valid.

### Scenario #2: 
Most authentication attacks occur due to the
continued use of passwords as a sole factor. Once considered
best practices, password rotation and complexity requirements
are viewed as encouraging users to use, and reuse, weak
passwords. Organizations are recommended to stop these
practices per NIST 800-63 and use multi-factor authentication.

### Scenario #3: 
Application session timeouts aren‚Äôt set properly. A
user uses a public computer to access an application. Instead of
selecting ‚Äúlogout‚Äù the user simply closes the browser tab and
walks away. An attacker uses the same browser an hour later,
and the user is still authenticated.
