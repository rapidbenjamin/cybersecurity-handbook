# A1 Injection

## Definition

Injection flaws, such as SQL, NoSQL, OS, and LDAP injection, occur when untrusted data is sent
to an interpreter as part of a command or query. The attacker‚Äôs hostile data can trick the
interpreter into executing unintended commands or accessing data without proper authorization.

## Is the Application Vulnerable?

An application is vulnerable to attack when:

- User-supplied data is not validated, filtered, or sanitized by the
application.
- Dynamic queries or non-parameterized calls without contextaware escaping are used directly in the interpreter.
- Hostile data is used within object-relational mapping (ORM)
search parameters to extract additional, sensitive records.
- Hostile data is directly used or concatenated, such that the
SQL or command contains both structure and hostile data in
dynamic queries, commands, or stored procedures.
Some of the more common injections are SQL, NoSQL, OS
command, Object Relational Mapping (ORM), LDAP, and
Expression Language (EL) or Object Graph Navigation Library
(OGNL) injection. The concept is identical among all interpreters.
Source code review is the best method of detecting if
applications are vulnerable to injections, closely followed by
thorough automated testing of all parameters, headers, URL,
cookies, JSON, SOAP, and XML data inputs. Organizations can
include static source (SAST) and dynamic application test
(DAST) tools into the CI/CD pipeline to identify newly introduced
injection flaws prior to production deployment. 

## How to Prevent

Preventing injection requires keeping data separate from
commands and queries

- The preferred option is to use a safe API, which avoids the use
of the interpreter entirely or provides a parameterized interface,
or migrate to use Object Relational Mapping Tools (ORMs).
Note: Even when parameterized, stored procedures can still
introduce SQL injection if PL/SQL or T-SQL concatenates
queries and data, or executes hostile data with EXECUTE
IMMEDIATE or exec().
- Use positive or "whitelist" server-side input validation. This is
not a complete defense as many applications require special
characters, such as text areas or APIs for mobile applications.
- For any residual dynamic queries, escape special characters
using the specific escape syntax for that interpreter.
Note: SQL structure such as table names, column names, and
so on cannot be escaped, and thus user-supplied structure
names are dangerous. This is a common issue in report-writing
software.
- Use LIMIT and other SQL controls within queries to prevent
mass disclosure of records in case of SQL injection.


## Example Attack Scenarios

### Scenario #1: 
An application uses untrusted data in the
construction of the following vulnerable SQL call:

```js
String query = "SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE
custID='" + request.getParameter("id") + "'";
```

### Scenario #2: Similarly, an application‚Äôs blind trust in frameworks
may result in queries that are still vulnerable, (e.g. Hibernate
Query Language (HQL)):

```js
Query HQLQuery = session.createQuery("FROM accounts
WHERE custID='" + request.getParameter("id") + "'");
```

In both cases, the attacker modifies the ‚Äòid‚Äô parameter value in
their browser to send: `' or '1'='1`. For example:

```js
http://example.com/app/accountView?id=' or '1'='1
```

This changes the meaning of both queries to return all the
records from the accounts table. More dangerous attacks could
modify or delete data, or even invoke stored procedures.
