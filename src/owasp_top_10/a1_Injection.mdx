## Definition

Injection flaws, such as SQL, NoSQL, OS, and LDAP injection, occur when untrusted data is sent
to an interpreter as part of a command or query. The attacker’s hostile data can trick the
interpreter into executing unintended commands or accessing data without proper authorization.

## Context

</iframe>

Almost any source of data can be an injection vector, environment
variables, parameters, external and
internal web services, and all types of
users. [Injection flaws](https://owasp.org/www-community/Injection_Flaws) occur when an
attacker can send hostile data to an
interpreter.

Injection flaws are very prevalent, particularly in
legacy code. Injection vulnerabilities are often found
in SQL, LDAP, XPath, or NoSQL queries, OS
commands, XML parsers, SMTP headers,
expression languages, and ORM queries.


Injection flaws are easy to discover when examining
code. Scanners and fuzzers can help attackers find
injection flaws.


Injection can result in data loss,
corruption, or disclosure to
unauthorized parties, loss of
accountability, or denial of access.

Injection can sometimes lead to
complete host takeover.


The business impact depends on the
needs of the application and data.


## Is the Application Vulnerable?

An application is vulnerable to attack when:

- User-supplied data is not validated, filtered, or sanitized by the
application.
- Dynamic queries or non-parameterized calls without contextaware escaping are used directly in the interpreter.
- Hostile data is used within object-relational mapping (ORM)
search parameters to extract additional, sensitive records.
- Hostile data is directly used or concatenated, such that the
SQL or command contains both structure and hostile data in
dynamic queries, commands, or stored procedures.
Some of the more common injections are SQL, NoSQL, OS
command, Object Relational Mapping (ORM), LDAP, and
Expression Language (EL) or Object Graph Navigation Library
(OGNL) injection. The concept is identical among all interpreters.
Source code review is the best method of detecting if
applications are vulnerable to injections, closely followed by
thorough automated testing of all parameters, headers, URL,
cookies, JSON, SOAP, and XML data inputs. Organizations can
include static source (SAST) and dynamic application test
(DAST) tools into the CI/CD pipeline to identify newly introduced
injection flaws prior to production deployment. 


## Conceptual Attacks


### Scenario #1: 
An application uses untrusted data in the
construction of the following vulnerable SQL call:

```js
const query = `SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE
custID='${request.getParameter("id")}'`;
```

### Scenario #2: Similarly, an application’s blind trust in frameworks
may result in queries that are still vulnerable, (e.g. Hibernate
Query Language (HQL)):

```js
const HQLQuery = session.createQuery(`FROM accounts
WHERE custID='${request.getParameter("id")}'`);
```

In both cases, the attacker modifies the ‘id’ parameter value in
their browser to send: `' or '1'='1`. For example:

```
http://example.com/app/accountView?id=' or '1'='1
```

This changes the meaning of both queries to return all the
records from the accounts table, since `'1'='1` will always evaluate TRUE. 
More dangerous attacks could modify or delete data, or even invoke stored procedures.



## Example Attack Scenarios

### SQL Injection: 

This example is based on  [Scott Smith example about Injections](http://scottksmith.com/blog/2015/06/08/secure-node-apps-against-owasp-top-10-injection/)

Our server code:
```js
const { mysqlConfig } = require('./config)
const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const mysql  = require('mysql');
const connection = mysql.createConnection(mysqlConfig);
const app = express();

//Middleware
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded());

// Routes
app.post('/login', (req, res) => {
  const { user, pass } = req.body;
  const sql = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE user = '${user}' AND pass = '${pass}'`;
  console.log(`SQL to be executed: ${sql}`)
  // connection.query(sql, (err, results) => {})
});
app.listen(8080);
```

our malicious request:
```
POST /login HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

user=admin'--&pass=pass
```

The final query is:
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE user = 'admin'--' AND pass = 'pass'
```
The problem here is that `"--"` renders everything that follows as a comment, thus returning the user info regardless of the password.

In this particular case the mitigation can be done by using [`escape` function built-it in `mysql` library](https://github.com/mysqljs/mysql#escaping-query-values).

```js
//...
const connection = mysql.createConnection(mysqlConfig);
//..

app.post('/login', (req, res) => {
  const user = connection.escape(req.body.user);
  const pass = connection.escape(req.body.pass);

  const sql = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE user = '${user}' AND pass = '${pass}'`;
  console.log(`SQL to be executed: ${sql}`)
  // connection.query(sql, (err, results) => {})
});
//..
```

Using the previous malicious payload you get a safe query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE user = 'admin''--' AND pass = 'pass'
```


### NON-SQL Injection:

This example is based on  [Scott Smith example about Injections](http://scottksmith.com/blog/2015/06/08/secure-node-apps-against-owasp-top-10-injection/)

Our server code:
```js
const MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient;
const { dbName, url } = require('./config).mongoConfig;
const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const app = express();
let db;

// DB Connection
MongoClient.connect(url, (err, client) => {
  if(err) throw err;
  console.log("Connected successfully to MongoDB");
  db = client.db(dbName);
  app.listen(8080);
});

//Middleware
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded());

// Routes
app.post('/login', (req, res) => {
  const { user, pass } = req.body;
  db.users.find({user: user, pass: pass});
});
```

our malicious request:
```
POST /login HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "user": {"$gt": ""},
    "pass": {"$gt": ""}
}
```

The final query will return all the users within the user collection
```js
db.users.find({user: { '$gt': '' }, pass: { '$gt': '' }});
```

In this particular case the mitigation can be done by using an explicit query selector.

```js
app.post('/login', (req, res) => {
  const { user, pass } = req.body;
  db.users.find({user: { $in: [user] }, pass: { $in: [pass] }});
});
```

Using the previous malicious payload you get a safe query now:

```sql
db.users.find({user: { $in: [{ '$gt': '' }] }, pass: { $in: [{ '$gt': '' }] }});
```


### OS Command Injection:

In this case we want to use [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/blob/master/README.md) to download a cool [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEkrWRHCDQU) to our local machine.

As `youtube-dl` is a Python library we will use [process child](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html) to run it in Nodejs. 

Note: This example is non very common, but is much better than the typical [`eval()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval) example.


Our server code:
```js
const { exec } = require('child_process');
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Routes
app.get('/download_video/:id', (req, res) => {
  const { id } = req.params;
  const cmd = `youtube-dl https://www.youtube.com/watch\?v\=${id}`
  exec(cmd, (error, stdout, stderr) => {
      if(error || stderr) return res.status(500).send(`😱 The video with id:${id} was not downloaded!`)
      res.send(`🎉 Video with id:${id} was downloaded!. ${stdout}`)
  })
});

app.listen(8080);
```

Our malicious request:
```
GET /download_video/KEkrWRHCDQU; printenv
```

This request will be translated to `youtube-dl https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEkrWRHCDQU; printenv`. So will include all the enviromental variables in the response.

To prevent this specific attack you can use a regex to validate the [Youtube video id](https://markmail.org/message/jb6nsveqs7hya5la) with a regex: `/^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{11}$/` and avoid to include the `stdout` or raw errors in the response.

Our server code:
```js
//..
const idValidation = (id) => {
    const re = /^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{11}$/;
    return re.test(String(id));
}

// Routes
app.get('/download_video/:id', (req, res) => {
  const { id } = req.params;
  if(!idValidation(id)) return res.status(400).send("You sent an invalid id!")
  const cmd = `youtube-dl https://www.youtube.com/watch\?v\=${id}`
  exec(cmd, (error, stdout, stderr) => {
      if(error || stderr) return res.status(500).send(`😱 The video with id:${id} was not downloaded!`)
      res.send(`🎉 Video with id:${id} was downloaded!.`)
  })
});
//..
```

Note: This kind of bugs in the design can easily lead to Backdoors. Check out [this post for more details](https://snyk.io/blog/what-is-a-backdoor/). 


### External content Injection:

It is very common to use Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to speed up our static content (css, js, etc...). If we are using a third party CDN we must use [Subresource Integrity
validation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity) in our HTML in order to prevent the execution on malicious content in case that the CDN got compromised and the files were replaced by malicious ones.

```html
<script src="https://example.com/example-framework.js"
    integrity="sha384-oqVuAfXRKap7fdgcCY5uykM6+R9GqQ8K/uxy9rx7HNQlGYl1kPzQho1wx4JwY8wC"
    crossorigin="anonymous">
</script>
```

As you can see the `integrity` property contains the hashed value of the file that we are expecting. This will allow the browser to check the integrity of the files downloaded before the execution.

Note: Most of the CDN services already had included this features, please use them

## How to Prevent

### General advice

Preventing injection requires keeping data separate from
commands and queries

- The preferred option is to use a safe API, which avoids the use
of the interpreter entirely or provides a parameterized interface,
or migrate to use Object Relational Mapping Tools (ORMs).
Note: Even when parameterized, stored procedures can still
introduce SQL injection if PL/SQL or T-SQL concatenates
queries and data, or executes hostile data with EXECUTE
IMMEDIATE or exec().
- Use positive or "whitelist" server-side input validation. This is
not a complete defense as many applications require special
characters, such as text areas or APIs for mobile applications.
- For any residual dynamic queries, escape special characters
using the specific escape syntax for that interpreter.
Note: SQL structure such as table names, column names, and
so on cannot be escaped, and thus user-supplied structure
names are dangerous. This is a common issue in report-writing
software.
- Use LIMIT and other SQL controls within queries to prevent
mass disclosure of records in case of SQL injection.

### Keys to mitigate

- Validate and sanitize any user input
- Strongly type your parameters
- Use parameterized queries for databases
- Configure your database account with the minimum permissions possible

## Extra mile: Unexpected injections

![Car with an SQL injection in as a plate](../../public/car_injection.jpg)

You always must sanitize all the Inputs. No matter where they came from. Any non-controller input can be a very harmful.
