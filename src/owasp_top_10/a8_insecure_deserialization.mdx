# A8 Insecure Deserialization


## Definition

Insecure deserialization often leads to remote code execution. Even if deserialization flaws do not
result in remote code execution, they can be used to perform attacks, including replay attacks,
injection attacks, and privilege escalation attacks. 

## Risk Factor Summary

- Score: 5.0
- Attack Vectors Exploitability: 1
- Security Weakness Prevalence: 2
- Security Weakness Detectability: 2
- Impact Technical: 3

## Context

</iframe>

Exploitation of deserialization is
somewhat difficult, as off the shelf
exploits rarely work without changes
or tweaks to the underlying exploit
code.


This issue is included in the Top 10 based on an
[industry survey](https://owasp.blogspot.com/2017/08/owasp-top-10-2017-project-update.html) and not on quantifiable data.

Some tools can discover deserialization flaws, but
human assistance is frequently needed to validate
the problem. It is expected that prevalence data for
deserialization flaws will increase as tooling is
developed to help identify and address it.


The impact of deserialization flaws
cannot be understated. These flaws
can lead to remote code execution
attacks, one of the most serious
attacks possible.


The business impact depends on the
protection needs of the application
and data.


## Is the Application Vulnerable?

Applications and APIs will be vulnerable if they deserialize hostile
or tampered objects supplied by an attacker.
This can result in two primary types of attacks:
- Object and data structure related attacks where the attacker
modifies application logic or achieves arbitrary remote code
execution if there are classes available to the application that
can change behavior during or after deserialization.
- Typical data tampering attacks, such as access-control-related
attacks, where existing data structures are used but the content
is changed.
Serialization may be used in applications for:
- Remote- and inter-process communication (RPC/IPC)
- Wire protocols, web services, message brokers
- Caching/Persistence
- Databases, cache servers, file systems
- HTTP cookies, HTML form parameters, API authentication
tokens 

## How to Prevent

The only safe architectural pattern is not to accept serialized
objects from untrusted sources or to use serialization mediums
that only permit primitive data types.
If that is not possible, consider one of more of the following:
- Implementing integrity checks such as digital signatures on any
serialized objects to prevent hostile object creation or data
tampering.
- Enforcing strict type constraints during deserialization before
object creation as the code typically expects a definable set of
classes. Bypasses to this technique have been demonstrated,
so reliance solely on this is not advisable.
- Isolating and running code that deserializes in low privilege
environments when possible.
- Logging deserialization exceptions and failures, such as where
the incoming type is not the expected type, or the
deserialization throws exceptions.
- Restricting or monitoring incoming and outgoing network
connectivity from containers or servers that deserialize.
- Monitoring deserialization, alerting if a user deserializes
constantly.

## Conceptual Attacks

### Scenario #1:
A React application calls a set of Spring Boot
microservices. Being functional programmers, they tried to
ensure that their code is immutable. The solution they came up
with is serializing user state and passing it back and forth with
each request. An attacker notices the "R00" Java object
signature, and uses the Java Serial Killer tool to gain remote
code execution on the application server.

### Scenario #2:
A PHP forum uses PHP object serialization to save
a "super" cookie, containing the user's user ID, role, password
hash, and other state:

```
a:4:{i:0;i:132;i:1;s:7:"Mallory";i:2;s:4:"user";
i:3;s:32:"b6a8b3bea87fe0e05022f8f3c88bc960";}
```

An attacker changes the serialized object to give themselves
admin privileges:

```
a:4:{i:0;i:1;i:1;s:5:"Alice";i:2;s:5:"admin";
i:3;s:32:"b6a8b3bea87fe0e05022f8f3c88bc960";}
```
