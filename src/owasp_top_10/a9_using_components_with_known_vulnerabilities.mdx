# A9 Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities



## Definition

Components, such as libraries, frameworks, and other software modules, run with the same
privileges as the application. If a vulnerable component is exploited, such an attack can facilitate
serious data loss or server takeover. Applications and APIs using components with known
vulnerabilities may undermine application defenses and enable various attacks and impacts. 

## Risk Factor Summary

- Score: 4.7
- Attack Vectors Exploitability: 2
- Security Weakness Prevalence: 3
- Security Weakness Detectability: 2
- Impact Technical: 2

</iframe>


While it is easy to find already-written
exploits for many known
vulnerabilities, other vulnerabilities
require concentrated effort to develop
a custom exploit.


Prevalence of this issue is very widespread.
Component-heavy development patterns can lead to
development teams not even understanding which
components they use in their application or API,
much less keeping them up to date.


Some scanners such as retire.js help in detection,
but determining exploitability requires additional
effort.


While some known vulnerabilities
lead to only minor impacts, some of
the largest breaches to date have
relied on exploiting known
vulnerabilities in components.
Depending on the assets you are
protecting, perhaps this risk should
be at the top of the list.

## Is the Application Vulnerable?

You are likely vulnerable:
- If you do not know the versions of all components you use
(both client-side and server-side). This includes components
you directly use as well as nested dependencies.
- If software is vulnerable, unsupported, or out of date. This
includes the OS, web/application server, database
management system (DBMS), applications, APIs and all
components, runtime environments, and libraries.
- If you do not scan for vulnerabilities regularly and subscribe to
security bulletins related to the components you use.
- If you do not fix or upgrade the underlying platform,
frameworks, and dependencies in a risk-based, timely fashion.
This commonly happens in environments when patching is a
monthly or quarterly task under change control, which leaves
organizations open to many days or months of unnecessary
exposure to fixed vulnerabilities.
- If software developers do not test the compatibility of updated,
upgraded, or patched libraries.
- If you do not secure the components' configurations
(see [A6:2017-Security Misconfiguration](/owasp/a6_security_misconfiguration)).

## How to Prevent

There should be a patch management process in place to:
- Check the dependencies tree. `npm ls`
- Check for outdated dependencies. `npm outdated`
- Remove unused dependencies, unnecessary features,
components, files, and documentation. `npx depcheck`
- Continuously inventory the versions of both client-side and
server-side components (e.g. frameworks, libraries) and their
dependencies using tools like [Snyk](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360003919937-Getting-started-with-the-CLI). 
- Continuously monitor sources like [CVE](https://cve.mitre.org/) and [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/)
for vulnerabilities in the components and subscribe to email
alerts for security vulnerabilities related to components you
use.. 
- Use software composition
analysis tools to automate the process or CI process to review your dependencies. 
- Only obtain components from official sources (NPM, Github, Docker Hub...) over secure links.
Prefer signed packages to reduce the chance of including a
modified, malicious component.
- Monitor for libraries and components that are unmaintained or
do not create security patches for older versions. 
- Every organization must ensure that there is an ongoing plan for
monitoring, triaging, and applying updates or configuration
changes for the lifetime of the application or portfolio. 
- Define security policies about which components are allowed to be used in the organization
- Use multi stage docker in order to use the minimum base possible like alpine once the image is built.

## Conceptual Attacks

### Scenario #1: 
Components typically run with the same privileges
as the application itself, so flaws in any component can result in
serious impact. Such flaws can be accidental (e.g. coding error)
or intentional (e.g. backdoor in component). Some example
exploitable component vulnerabilities discovered are:
- [CVE-2017-5638](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5638), a Struts 2 remote code execution vulnerability
that enables execution of arbitrary code on the server, has
been blamed for significant breaches.
- While [internet of things (IoT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) are frequently difficult or
impossible to patch, the importance of patching them can be
great (e.g. biomedical devices).
There are automated tools to help attackers find unpatched or
misconfigured systems. For example, the Shodan IoT search
engine can help you [find devices](https://www.shodan.io/report/89bnfUyJ) that still suffer from
the [Heartbleed vulnerability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed) that was patched in April 2014.
