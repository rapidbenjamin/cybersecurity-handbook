## Definition

Many older or poorly configured XML processors evaluate external entity references within XML
documents. External entities can be used to disclose internal files using the file URI handler,
internal file shares, internal port scanning, remote code execution, and denial of service attacks.

## Risk Factor Summary

- Score: 7.0
- Attack Vectors Exploitability: 2
- Security Weakness Prevalence: 2
- Security Weakness Detectability: 3
- Impact Technical: 3

## Context

</iframe>

Attackers can exploit vulnerable XML
processors if they can upload XML or
include hostile content in an XML
document, exploiting vulnerable code,
dependencies or integrations. 

By default, many older XML processors allow
specification of an external entity, a URI that is
dereferenced and evaluated during XML processing.

SAST tools can discover this issue by inspecting
dependencies and configuration. DAST tools require
additional manual steps to detect and exploit this
issue. Manual testers need to be trained in how to
test for XXE, as it not commonly tested as of 2017.

These flaws can be used to extract
data, execute a remote request from
the server, scan internal systems,
perform a denial-of-service attack, as
well as execute other attacks.

The business impact depends on the
protection needs of all affected
application and data.

## Is the Application Vulnerable?

Applications and in particular XML-based web services or
downstream integrations might be vulnerable to attack if:
- The application accepts XML directly or XML uploads,
especially from untrusted sources, or inserts untrusted data into
XML documents, which is then parsed by an XML processor.
- Any of the XML processors in the application or SOAP based
web services has [document type definitions (DTDs)](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_dtd_intro.asp) enabled.
As the exact mechanism for disabling DTD processing varies
by processor, it is good practice to consult a reference such as
the [OWASP Cheat Sheet 'XXE Prevention'](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/XML_External_Entity_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html).
- If your application uses SAML for identity processing within
federated security or single sign on (SSO) purposes. SAML
uses XML for identity assertions, and may be vulnerable.
- If the application uses SOAP prior to version 1.2, it is likely
susceptible to XXE attacks if XML entities are being passed to
the SOAP framework.
- Being vulnerable to XXE attacks likely means that the
application is vulnerable to denial of service attacks including
the Billion Laughs attack.

## How to Prevent

Developer training is essential to identify and mitigate XXE.
Besides that, preventing XXE requires:
- Whenever possible, use less complex data formats such as
JSON, and avoiding serialization of sensitive data.
- Patch or upgrade all XML processors and libraries in use by
the application or on the underlying operating system. Use
dependency checkers. Update SOAP to SOAP 1.2 or higher.
- Disable XML external entity and DTD processing in all XML
parsers in the application, as per the [OWASP Cheat Sheet
'XXE Prevention']((https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/XML_External_Entity_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html)).
- Implement positive ("whitelisting") server-side input validation,
filtering, or sanitization to prevent hostile data within XML
documents, headers, or nodes.
- Verify that XML or XSL file upload functionality validates
incoming XML using XSD validation or similar.
- SAST tools can help detect XXE in source code, although
manual code review is the best alternative in large, complex
applications with many integrations.
If these controls are not possible, consider using virtual
patching, API security gateways, or Web Application Firewalls
(WAFs) to detect, monitor, and block XXE attacks.

## Conceptual Attacks

Numerous public XXE issues have been discovered, including
attacking embedded devices. XXE occurs in a lot of unexpected
places, including deeply nested dependencies. The easiest way
is to upload a malicious XML file, if accepted:

### Scenario #1: 
The attacker attempts to extract data from the server:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<!DOCTYPE foo [
<!ELEMENT foo ANY >
<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd" >]>
<foo>&xxe;</foo>
```

### Scenario #2: 

An attacker probes the server's private network by changing the above ENTITY line to:
```xml
<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "https://192.168.1.1/private" >]>
```

### Scenario #3: 
An attacker attempts a denial-of-service attack by including a potentially endless file:

```xml
<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///dev/random" >]>
```

### Scenario #4:

An attacker attempts a denial-of-service attack by expanding entities, like [Billion laughs attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion_laughs_attack).
