## Definition

Many web applications and APIs do not properly protect sensitive data, such as financial,
healthcare, and PII. Attackers may steal or modify such weakly protected data to conduct credit
card fraud, identity theft, or other crimes. Sensitive data may be compromised without extra
protection, such as encryption at rest or in transit, and requires special precautions when
exchanged with the browser.

## Risk Factor Summary

- Score: 7.0
- Attack Vectors Exploitability: 2
- Security Weakness Prevalence: 3
- Security Weakness Detectability: 2
- Impact Technical: 3

## Context

</iframe>

Rather than directly attacking crypto,
attackers steal keys, execute man-inthe-middle attacks, or steal clear text
data off the server, while in transit, or
from the user‚Äôs client, e.g. browser. A
manual attack is generally required.
Previously retrieved password
databases could be brute forced by
Graphics Processing Units (GPUs).

Over the last few years, this has been the most
common impactful attack. The most common flaw is
simply not encrypting sensitive data. When crypto is
employed, weak key generation and management,
and weak algorithm, protocol and cipher usage is
common, particularly for weak password hashing
storage techniques. For data in transit, server side
weaknesses are mainly easy to detect, but hard for
data at rest. 

Failure frequently compromises all
data that should have been protected.
Typically, this information includes
sensitive personal information (PII)
data such as health records, credentials, personal data, and credit cards,
which often require protection as
defined by laws or regulations such as
the EU GDPR or local privacy laws.

## Is the Application Vulnerable?

The first thing is to determine the protection needs of data in
transit and at rest. For example, passwords, credit card numbers,
health records, personal information and business secrets
require extra protection, particularly if that data falls under
privacy laws, e.g. EU's General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR), or regulations, e.g. financial data protection such as
PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). For all such data:
- Is any data transmitted in clear text? This concerns protocols
such as HTTP, SMTP, and FTP. External internet traffic is
especially dangerous. Verify all internal traffic e.g. between
load balancers, web servers, or back-end systems.
- Is sensitive data stored in clear text, including backups?
- Are any old or weak cryptographic algorithms used either by
default or in older code?
- Are default crypto keys in use, weak crypto keys generated or
re-used, or is proper key management or rotation missing?
- Is encryption not enforced, e.g. are any user agent (browser)
security directives or headers missing?
- Does the user agent (e.g. app, mail client) not verify if the
received server certificate is valid?


## Conceptual Attacks

![meme - you can't leak passwords if you don't store them](../../public/meme_02.png)

### Scenario #1: 
An application encrypts credit card numbers in a
database using automatic database encryption. However, this
data is automatically decrypted when retrieved, allowing an SQL
injection flaw to retrieve credit card numbers in clear text.


### Scenario #2: 
A site doesn't use or enforce TLS for all pages or
supports weak encryption. An attacker monitors network traffic
(e.g. at an insecure wireless network), downgrades connections
from HTTPS to HTTP, intercepts requests, and steals the user's
session cookie. The attacker then replays this cookie and hijacks
the user's (authenticated) session, accessing or modifying the
user's private data. Instead of the above they could alter all
transported data, e.g. the recipient of a money transfer.


### Scenario #3: 
The password database uses unsalted or simple
hashes to store everyone's passwords. A file upload flaw allows
an attacker to retrieve the password database. All the unsalted
hashes can be exposed with a rainbow table of pre-calculated
hashes. Hashes generated by simple or fast hash functions may
be cracked by GPUs, even if they were salted.


## How to Prevent

Do the following, at a minimum, and consult the references:
- Classify data processed, stored, or transmitted by an
application. Identify which data is sensitive according to privacy
laws, regulatory requirements, or business needs.
- Apply controls as per the classification.
- Don‚Äôt store sensitive data unnecessarily. Discard it as soon as
possible or use PCI DSS compliant tokenization or even
truncation. Data that is not retained cannot be stolen.
- Make sure to encrypt all sensitive data at rest.
- Ensure up-to-date and strong standard algorithms, protocols,
and keys are in place; use proper key management.
- Encrypt all data in transit with secure protocols such as TLS
with perfect forward secrecy (PFS) ciphers, cipher prioritization
by the server, and secure parameters. Enforce encryption
using directives like HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS).
- Disable caching for responses that contain sensitive data.
- Store passwords using strong adaptive and salted hashing
functions with a work factor (delay factor), such as [Argon2](https://www.cryptolux.org/index.php/Argon2),
[scrypt](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt), [bcrypt](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt), or [PBKDF2](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2).
- Verify independently the effectiveness of configuration and
settings.
