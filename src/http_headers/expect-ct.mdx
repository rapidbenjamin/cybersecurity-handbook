# HTTP Header: Expect-CT


## The attack

> Expect-CT is an HTTP header that allows sites to opt in to reporting and/or enforcement of Certificate Transparency requirements, which prevents the use of misissued certificates for that site from going unnoticed. When a site enables the Expect-CT header, they are requesting that Chrome check that any certificate for that site appears in public CT logs.
> _by [Chrome platform](https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5677171733430272)_


## The header

The `Expect-CT` HTTP header tells browsers to expect Certificate Transparency.

## The code


```js
const helmet = require('helmet')

app.use(helmet())

// Sets Expect-CT: max-age=123
app.use(helmet.expectCt({ maxAge: 123 }))

// Sets Expect-CT: enforce; max-age=123
app.use(helmet.expectCt({
  enforce: true,
  maxAge: 123
}))
```

You can define a report url. This will help you to analyze the impact on your users with old browsers. [Check compatibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Expect-CT) 

```js
// Sets Expect-CT: enforce; max-age=30; report-uri="http://example.com/report"
app.use(helmet.expectCt({
  enforce: true,
  maxAge: 30,
  reportUri: 'http://example.com/report'
}))
```
