# HTTP Header: Referrer Policy

## The attack

The Referrer Policy module can control the behavior of the `Referer` header by setting the `Referrer-Policy` header.

The [`Referer` HTTP header](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_referer) is typically set by web browsers to tell a server where it’s coming from. For example, if you click a link on `example.com/index.html` that takes you to `wikipedia.org`, Wikipedia’s servers will see `Referer: example.com`.

This can have privacy implications—websites can see where users are coming from.

## The header

The new [`Referrer-Policy` HTTP header](https://www.w3.org/TR/referrer-policy/#referrer-policy-header) lets authors control how browsers set the `Referer` header.

For example, when supported browsers see this header, they will set no `Referer` header at all:

```
Referrer-Policy: no-referrer
```

There are other directives, too. `same-origin`, for example, will only send the `Referer` header for pages on the same origin.

```
Referrer-Policy: same-origin
```

You can see the full list of directives on [the specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/referrer-policy/#referrer-policies) and [support in all browsers](http://caniuse.com/#feat=referrer-policy)


## The code

```js
const helmet = require('helmet')

// Sets "Referrer-Policy: same-origin".
app.use(helmet.referrerPolicy({ policy: 'same-origin' }))
```
